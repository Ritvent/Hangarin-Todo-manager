## Hangarin: Task and Todo Manager 📝

Hangarin is a simple web application I built for our App Development activity.  
It’s designed to help users organize their daily tasks, manage priorities, add notes, and break down large goals into smaller subtasks.  

This project was a great way for me to explore how Django can be used to create practical web apps, while also learning about deployment.


## 🌟 Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Categorize tasks by priority  
- Add notes for better context  
- Break down large goals into smaller, manageable subtasks  
- Simple and clean interface  



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Django (Python)  
- **Frontend:** Django   
- **Database:** SQLite 
- **Deployment:** PythonAnywhere  



## 🚀 Deployment
One of the biggest learnings for me was deploying the app on **PythonAnywhere**.  
I learned how to:
- Configure Django settings for production  
- Set up static files for deployment  
- Use WSGI to connect Django with the hosting server  

It was exciting (and a bit challenging) to see the project running live outside my local machine!

## 📖 Learnings
Through building **Hangarin**, I was able to practice:
- Creating and linking Django models, views, and templates  
- Using Django Admin for quick management of data  
- Understanding how to structure a project for scalability  
- Handling priorities and subtasks in a relational database  
- Deploying a Django project for the first time  

This activity really showed me how coding can move from just "running locally" to being an actual app that people can access online.
